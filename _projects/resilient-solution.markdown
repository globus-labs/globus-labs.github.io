<!--
Add your project description below according to these guidelines.

 - Use Markdown syntax everywhere, not HTML!
 - Use active voice ("we")
 - Limit the intro paragraph to 3 sentences or less.
 - Keep the overall length under 3 paragraphs.
 - Bullet points are helpful for quickly understanding key points.
 - Add figures and additional links if relevant.

An example first paragraph:

 1. Sentence giving overall context, hinting at the problem we solve.
      "Most humans don't like to read long paragraphs and writing short
      ones takes thought."
 2. An explanation of how we fix it.
      "We made a simple template that you can follow for how to write one."
 3. A statement of impact.
      "Any Globus Labs member need only edit this template to make their
      science more accessible."
