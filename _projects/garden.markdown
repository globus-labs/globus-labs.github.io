AI methods are increasingly common in the sciences, but reusing models made by other research groups is a struggle. Garden makes it easy for researchers to publish their models in runnable form, available over API on research computing clusters. Researchers can then curate "gardens" of connected models, data, and benchmarks in their field.

Check it out at [thegardens.ai](thegardens.ai).
